# In order to be usable from the WebExtension app, which expects an ordinary
# Cargo dependency, and the Android and iOS apps, which expect specific kinds of
# library formats, we must explicitly define multiple crate-type options. They'll
# all be built, and our consuming apps will use the right one. See #20 for
# discussion.
